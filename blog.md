# Teaching Digital Organisation

This will be the most interesting blog on a how to teach _Digital Organisation_.

The core idea is not to theoretically present Digital Organisation on slides, but the let students experience and construct a digital organisation.

For this they are going to use

- digital tools, such as Miro or Mural
- workflows, such as git in GitHub
- "program" lightly in Markdown

They will also get to know the philosophy of agile organisations, such as "customer centricity", "customer-producer-relationships", "motivation", "retros" and much more.
